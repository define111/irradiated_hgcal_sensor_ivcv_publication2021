\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
Exposing silicon sensors to radiation introduces defects in the bulk and with it worsens their electrical properties in view of their application as particle detectors.
In particular, the bulk-dominated leakage current density is expected to increase proportionally with the fluence, and sensors are expected to deplete at higher bias voltages with increasing fluence levels.
Annealing can cure radiation-induced defects to some extent, hereby reducing the degradation of the leakage current and the depletion voltage.
In this section, these behaviors are experimentally verified for full CMS HGCAL prototype silicon sensors for the first time.
Their electrical characterisation was performed both before and after a beneficial annealing for \SI{80}{\min} at \SI{60}{\celsius}\footnote{Corresponding to about 14$~$days at room temperature.}, and always at a temperature of \SI{-40}{\celsius}.
In summary, our results are overall consistent with previous R$\&$D on irradiated silicon sensors, hence demonstrating the intended radiation-hardness of the HGCAL silicon sensors.
Simultaneously, our results contribute towards the qualification of the RINSC neutron-irradiation facility, cf.~\ref{sec:irradiation}, as a reliable irradiation facility for $\mathcal{O}(\SI{10}{\centi\metre})$ large silicon wafers.

\end{figure}
The total leakage current is defined as the current flowing through R$_\text{HV}$ in \ref{fig:switchprobecard_CAD} and can be understood as the dark current of a full silicon wafer.
As it is exemplified for two prototype sensors in \ref{plot:tot_IV_good}, the total leakage current did not exhibit exponential growth and stayed well below the ARRAY system compliance of \SI{2}{\milli\ampere} for most of the irradiated sensors that were tested up to \SI{850}{\volt} at \SI{-40}{\celsius}.
Irreversible discharges are undesired but in fact occurred for a handful of the tested sensors where the total leakage current during electrical characterisation suddenly increased and exceeded the \SI{2}{\milli\ampere} limitation.
Whereas one half of those instances could be traced back to pre-existing conditions such as mechanical damages induced during the irradiation or the transport, the other half lead to a design modification of the HGCAL silicon sensors which should minimise the risk of discharges in the future\footnote{More than 20 prototype sensors with the improved design have been characterized with voltages up to \SI{850}{\volt} in the meantime. None have shown discharges thus far.}.
Results of the affected sensors are not discussed further in this work.
\ref{plot:pad_IV_channels} shows the per-pad leakage current as a function of the effective bias voltage (\emph{IV}) for adjacent pads on one representative sensor irradiated to intermediate fluences.
In general, our data demonstrate that the leakage current of a pad after irradiation scales with its volume, and that the relative increase from \SI{600}{\volt} to \SI{800}{\volt} remains well below \SI{150}{\percent}.
The beneficial effect of annealing on the leakage current has been studied in more detail for a sensor which was not exposed to high temperatures and with it was not affected by significant annealing during irradiation.
The measured IV curves after different annealing times are shown for a representative pad in \ref{plot:annealing_IV}.

\end{figure}
For bias voltages beyond full depletion, per-pad leakage currents at \SI{600}{\volt} are reduced systematically by \SI{25}{\percent} after \SI{80}{\minute} at \SI{60}{\celsius}, cf.~\ref{plot:annealing_current}.
Given the simultaneous reduction in the depletion voltage, cf.~\ref{plot:annealing_CV}, leakage currents around full depletion are even reduced further, namely by \SI{35}{\percent} (not shown).
After annealing all sensors to an equivalent of \SI{80}{\minute} at \SI{60}{\celsius}, we observe the expected proportionality of the per-pad leakage current density to the anticipated fluence that the sensors was exposed to.
The proportionality for current densities interpolated to an effective bias voltage of \SI{600}{\volt}, which is well above full depletion for the investigated sensors, and extrapolated to \SI{20}{\celsius} is displayed in \ref{plot:alpha_600}.

		Measured leakage currents are scaled to a room-temperature of \SI{20}{\celsius}.

\end{figure}
The current-related damage rate ($\alpha$) is found to be independent of the silicon material properties investigated in this work which is consistent with previous findings, e.g. Ref.~\cite{MOLL199987}.
However, the numerical result for $\alpha$ is about \SI{15}{\percent} smaller than the literature value~\cite{moll:SiDamages}, hereby potentially indicating a systematic overestimate of the fluence at the RINSC irradiation facility. 
Even after correction for the chuck temperature non-uniformity, per-pad leakage current densities across a sensor at a fixed voltage differ by up to \SI{20}{\percent}.
The associated current profiles are present both before (\ref{plot:iv_hexplot_3009,plot:iv_hexplot_0541_04,plot:iv_hexplot_1013}) and after additional annealing (\ref{plot:iv_hexplot_3009_annealed,plot:iv_hexplot_0541_04_annealed,plot:iv_hexplot_1013_annealed}), are continuous, and are identical for sensors that had been irradiated simultaneously in the same puck.
These findings are interpreted as evidence for the presence of a gaussian-like ($\sigma\approx\mathcal{O}(\SI{10}{\centi\metre})$) fluence profile within the beamport of the RINSC irradiation facility.

\subsection{Capacitance and Depletion Voltage}
\label{subsec:Udep}

The measured per-channel complex impedances are open-corrected by subtracting the impedance of the ARRAY system.
Subsequently, the sensor pad capacitances are computed assuming an underlying serial circuitry.
Due to the finite mobility of the sensor defects, the frequency at which the impedance is measured may, in principle, have sizeable impact on the capacitances and on the hereby derived depletion voltages for irradiated silicon pad sensors, cf. Ref.~\cite{Li1991}.
The impedance measurement for the results presented in this section was conducted at an LCR-frequency ($f_\text{LCR}$) of \SI{2}{\kilo\hertz}.
Experimental follow-up studies indicate a negligible impact of \SI{2}{\percent} on the asymptotic capacitance and a \SI{10}{\percent} reduction of the depletion voltage when decreasing $f_\text{LCR}$ to \SI{500}{\hertz}.
This dependence of the capacitance and the depletion voltage on $f_\text{LCR}$ has no practical implications on the following discussion.
The depletion voltage for each pad is assessed from the saturation of its squared reciprocal pad capacitance ($C^{-2}$) with respect to the effective bias voltage ($V$). 
It is defined as the intersection of a straight-line fitted to the rising part of the $C^{-2}-V$ with a line fitted to its plateau.
Prior to additional annealing, such a plateau could not always be reached within the tested bias voltage range for all sensors, c.f. the black line in \ref{plot:annealing_CV}. 
Thus, only results from sensors after additional annealing to \SI{80}{\min} at \SI{60}{\celsius}, where the estimated depletion voltage has been reduced by about a third with respect to the case without annealing, cf.~\ref{plot:annealing_Vdep}, are discussed below.

\end{figure}
We find that the per-pad capacitance after irradiation still scales reasonably well with the area of the pad, cf.~\ref{plot:annealing_CV}.
Deviations from this scaling amount to less than \SI{5}{\percent} which can likely be explained by different inter-pad capacitances between the pads (measured to be \SI{2}{\pico\farad} between full pads).
Verification of this hypothesis is beyond the scope of this paper. 
\ref{plot:pad_invCV_sensor} illustrates that the estimated depletion voltages in this work scale primarily with the associated thickness of the depleted zone. 
Secondarily, the depletion voltage increases with the irradiation fluence which is displayed in~\ref{plot:Vdep_vs_current_5414}.
It demonstrates positive correlation between the depletion voltage estimates for an example sensor (cf. \ref{plot:Vdep_hexplot_0541_04}) with the leakage currents, taken as proxy for the fluence.
In fact, the obtained correlation coefficient is positive for all tested sensors.

\label{subsec:RINSC}
RINSC (Rhode Island Nuclear Science Center) is a 2 MW, light water cooled, pool type reactor in Narragansett, Rhode Island, USA.
At RINSC there are three (six?) different ways to irradiate materials: beamports (pipes that run from the work area to the reactor core), rabbit system (pneumatic system that ferries plastic sample bottles to the reactor core), and InCore tubes (small samples are placed into a tube and lowered into an empty basket next to the fuel elements). 
The beamports can accomodate samples of up to 7.75" x 3' [diameter by length], the rabbit system can accept sampes 1.125" x 6.25", and the InCore system can irradiate objects 1.25" x 9". 
Of the irradiation methods available, only the beamports are large enough to accomodate the silicon sensors for this project.

    \item Fig 1 - image(s) of reactor core, beamport (see fig~\ref{fig:RINSC_Facility})
    what other details are useful here?
    \item Fig 2 - puck design/layout, real pucks (see fig~\ref{fig:Pucks_Arrayed})
    \item Fig 3 - puck layout, packing
    \item Fig 4 - other hardware, cylinder, temp monitoring setup
    \item Fig 5 - schemaitc of experimental setup? Is this needed?
\end{itemize}

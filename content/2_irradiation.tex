\subsection{Rhode Island Nuclear Reactor}
\label{subsec:RINSC}
"What we, as a group, were given in terms of infrastructure." \textcolor{red}{Responsible: Nick}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Reactor description, incl. particle spectrum (if available), expected peak fluence rate (only if something was known a priori, otherwise discuss in~\ref{subsec:fluence_assessment})
  \item sketch of the reactor incl. beamport. Other two sytems can be included in the sketch, should be mentioned in a side-sentence.
  \item Focus should be on the beamport because that is the only way one can irradiate such large sensors. Hence, incl. photo (ideally with annotations)
\end{itemize}

RINSC (Rhode Island Nuclear Science Center) is a 2 MW, light water cooled, pool type reactor in Narragansett, Rhode Island, USA.
The core consists of fuel assemblies reflected with a combination of graphite and beryllium.
The fuel is plate type U3Si2 cladded with aluminum enriched to less than 20% Uranium-235.
At RINSC there are six different methods to irradiate materials, but only one of these, the 8 inch beamport, will be discussed in this paper as it is the only sample delivery system large enough to accept full-sized sensors.
The 8 inch beamport used for these studies can accomodate samples of up to 7.75" x 3'.
This specific beamport had not been used for nearly 30 years prior to these studies, and as a result there is no previous dosimetry data available to this project.
A sketch of the 8 inch beamport used is shown in Figure .~\ref{fig:Beamport_Schematic}.
The beamport measures 161.5 inches from the opening to the termination near to the reactor core.
A shutter assembly sits 120.25 inches from the opening of the beamport, and the shutter must be raised to allow for the insertion of the experimental setup and closed prior to the start of the reactor.
A lead plug, measuring 34.5 inches, is also inserted into the opening of the beamport prior to the start of irradiation.
To work within the constraints of this system a sample delivery method was developed to allow for: positioning sensors as close to the reactor core as possible; protecting them from physical damage during the loading, irradiation, and unloading; keeping the irradiated sensors cold before they are transferred into a freezer; and measuring the temperature throughout the irradiation run.   

\subsection{Irradiation of HGCAL silicon sensor prototypes}
\label{subsec:irradiation}
"What had to be developed in order to conduct the irradiations?" \textcolor{red}{Responsible: Nick}

Two compatible pieces of hardware were developed for the irradiation of these silicon sensors: a sensor container referred to as a hockey puck and a sample delivery cylinder. 
The hockey puck is used to protect, orient, and store the sensors during irradiation. 
The cylinder is used to protect and locate the hockey puck inside the beamport.

The cylinder is made from 6061 aluminum. 
It must have an OD of 7.8125 inches or less to fit within the ID of the beamport, and the ID of the cylinder must be no less than 7.5 inches to allow for smooth insertion and removal of the hockey pucks.
The cylinder has a welded cap on the end that faces the reactor core and a removable cap with threaded holes for 8-32 countersunk flat head machine screws that are flush with the OD of the cylinder. 
Both the welded cap and removable cap have vent holes to allow for air to flow into and out of the cylinder.
An eye bolt is screwed into the removable cap to facilitate removing the cylinder from the beamport after irradiations.

The hockey pucks have been made from a variety of different materials including oak, acrylic, and PEEK. 
The puck base has an OD of 7 and 7/16 inches to allow for a smooth fit inside the cylinder, and the interior of the puck is milled out in the profile of the silicon sensors with an additional clearance of 1mm. 
With these constraints the thinnest sections of the wall of the puck are slightly over 1mm thick which provides a difficult machining challenge.
The puck has a lid, made from the same material as the base, matches the OD of the base and provides a way to close the puck during handling.
Matching through holes in the base and lid allow for using nylon threaded rods and nuts to fasten the puck together. 

Antistatic foam is used for mechanical protection of the sensors inside the puck.
Kapton foils are also used to separate sensors in a stack so no sensors are in direct contact with any rough surfaces.
For this project sensors were irradiated in batches of four, which required ten layers of Kapton foils and three to four layers of antistatic foam. 

Description of temperature monitoring with RTDs, locations inside puck, readout system, example temperature plot.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Puck and other hardware for placement of the sensors into the beamport
  \item Temperature (!) as it may cause annealing (affecting the IV+CV results). Usage of dry ice.
  \item Temperature monitoring essential. Show illustrative temperature-vs-time graph during irradiation round. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fluence Assessment}
"What were the achieved fluences?" \textcolor{red}{Responsible: Nick}
\label{subsec:fluence_assessment}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Explain how fluence was extracted (diodes, integrated power, ...?)
\end{itemize}

Description of D0 diodes, pin diodes, and iron foils. 
Copy from review slides about which are useful at what fluences. 

\subsection{List of Neutron-Irradiated Sensors}
\label{subsec:sensors_irradiation}
"Which sensors were irradiated"? \textcolor{red}{Responsible: Thorben}
\begin{itemize}
  \item full table of sensors irradiated in first campaign (see .~\ref{fig:Irradiation_Schedule}). Do we want to include sensors irradiated prior to the main campaign? On the order of 10 or so sensors irradiated prior to this campaign.
\end{itemize}

Chest freezer has been installed a few steps away from the beamport with enough storage capacity for 3 cylinders.

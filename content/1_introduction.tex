% The Large Hadron Collider at CERN will be upgraded to provide more instantaneous luminosity~\cite{hllhc-tdr:2017}.
% Experiments, such as CMS, need to upgrade their detector systems. 
%One of the CMS upgrades is the replacement of the current endcap calorimeters with the High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL)~\cite{hgcal-tdr:2018}.
% Silicon sensors will be used and their electrical properties are important to assess after irradiation.
% This is what we will show here.
% Exposing silicon sensors to radiation introduces defects in the bulk and with it worsens their electrical properties in view of their application as particle detectors.
% In particular, the bulk-dominated leakage current density is expected to increase proportionally with the fluence, and sensors are expected to deplete at higher bias voltages with increasing fluence levels.
% Annealing can cure radiation-induced defects to some extent, hereby reducing the degradation of the leakage current and the depletion voltage.

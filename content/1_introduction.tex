\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The Large Hadron Collider at CERN will be upgraded to provide more instantaneous luminosity~\cite{hllhc-tdr:2017}.
Experiments, such as CMS, need to upgrade their detector systems. 
One of the CMS upgrades is the replacement of the current endcap calorimeters with the High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL)~\cite{hgcal-tdr:2018}.
Silicon sensors will be used and their electrical properties are important to assess after irradiation.
This is what we will show here.

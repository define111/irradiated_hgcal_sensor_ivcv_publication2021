\acknowledgments
We thank the staff at the Rhode Island Nuclear Science Center for their support during the preparation and execution of the neutron irradiation of the HGCAL silicon pad sensor prototypes.
The EP-DT and the former EP-LCD group at CERN have developed essential infrastructure, such as the ARRAY system including the associated data acquisition software, and have co-financed the acquisition of the utilised cold-chuck probe station at CERN.
Without their input, this R$\&$D milestone towards the realisation of this novel calorimeter would not have been possible. 
We are thankful for the technical and administrative support at CERN and at other CMS institutes and thank the staffs for their contributions to the success of the CMS effort. 
We acknowledge the enduring support provided by the following funding agencies and laboratories: BMBWF and FWF (Austria); CERN; CAS, MoST, and NSFC (China); MSES and CSF (Croatia); CEA, CNRS/IN2P3 and P2IO LabEx (ANR- 10-LABX-0038) (France); SRNSF (Georgia); BMBF, DFG, and HGF (Germany); GSRT (Greece); DAE and DST (India); MES (Latvia); MOE and UM (Malaysia); MOS (Montenegro); PAEC (Pakistan); FCT (Portugal); JINR (Dubna); MON, RosAtom, RAS, RFBR, and NRC KI (Russia); MoST (Taipei); ThEP Center, IPST, STAR, and NSTDA (Thailand); TUBITAK and TENMAK (Turkey); STFC (United Kingdom); and DOE (USA).
